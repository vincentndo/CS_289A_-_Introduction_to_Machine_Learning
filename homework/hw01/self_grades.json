With that assumption, my solution is valid. Since the domain is finite of size d, if you sample x times (distinct values), then you cover x/d chance already (like lottery when you by x distinct ticket from a pool of d tickets). The chance for you to win is x/d.","3_1":"10","3_1_text":"","3_2":"10","3_2_text":"","3_3":"8","3_3_text":"Messed up union bound.
